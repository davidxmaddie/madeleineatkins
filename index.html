	<p style="font-size: 24px;">Remy is my cute, mischievous, lovable dog who likes it when I take him out for a walk. He's my little photographer helper and model. He enjoys me taking pictures of him.</p>

</a>
	<p style="font-size: 24px;">Remy likes to cuddle with me at night and sleeps on my head when I go to sleep, and cries whenever I have to leave to go to School or go to work in the morning. He's so CUTE, he makes me want to cry.</p>
